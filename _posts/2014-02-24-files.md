files is a simple file management platform i needed to distribute files to the public

## features
 * simple clean interface
 * fast way to share files
 * organize files into folders
 * md-files are rendered to proper HTML
 * client script for easily adding temporary files
 * pastebin mode

## workflow
1. [Sender] Upload a file using either a web based client the commandline client
2. [Server] Store File on Fileserver and report back the unique url
3. [Sender] Share the url
4. [Receiver] Dowload file


## puppy (commandline client)
**pup.py** is a python script for fast adding files to your files-server
usage: `pup <filename>`

* uploads files to a system-folder called 'temp'
* assigns the file a random 8-char hash
* returns the full url on commandline

example:
{% highlight BASH %}
pup screenshot.png
Successfully uploaded screenshot.png to http://files.doebi.at/temp/WQN2qHUg.
{% endhighlight %}

## pastebin mode
for simple and fast text and sourcecode exchange you can use **pin**

* uses vims :TOhtml to highlight source code in your favourite colors
* uploads files using **pup**

example:
{% highlight BASH %}
pin snippet.text
Successfully uploaded snippet.text.html to http://files.doebi.at/temp/8qDcZwsH.
{% endhighlight %}

## planned features
* automatically delete temporary files after a certain time
* security (E2E Encryption)

## security
Unfortunately, as of now there is no security at all.
But with the current architecture it can easily be added anytime, asuming key exchange has already happened elsewhere.
