spoiler: "A map of our local town's tram system to display realtime data. Each station is pimped with LEDs to display trains at this station. Trains of line 1 are displayed red, line 2 green and line 3 blue. If trains meet on a station mixed colors are displayed, due to RGB color codes. This Frame is exhibited in our local Hackerspace /dev/lol"
