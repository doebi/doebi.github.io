### A Weatherapp for the SHA2017 Badge

In preparation for the camp, i did some app development for the badge.
The result was a simple weather app, that shows the weather for the next 24 hours in 6 hour steps.

At the time of writing the app, the platform was still a work in progress and mainly undocumented.
But the Badge Team was very helpful in their IRC channel.
The most tricky party were the condition icons, for which I created a custom font to get them displayed.
Apparently this app was the first one created by someone outside the badge team.
I actually did this app as a warm-up task for more sophisticated apps, which I never got to finish. :/
