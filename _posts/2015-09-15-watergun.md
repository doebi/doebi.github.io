The ESP8266 is an incredibly cheap and yet powerful microcontroller with Wi-Fi being its most famous feature.
From this specs I have born the idea of creating a self-contained browsergame.
Meaning that the chip is serving a website containing a browsergame, while also acting as a physical controller for the game.
The only thing needed in addition is a Wi-Fi enabled device for running and displaying the game, which sits in every persons pocket.
