[CraftUI](https://doebi.github.io/craftui/) lets you create touch interfaces on physical surfaces and was initially developed for glass surfaces like public show windows. While this is a very basic concept, we believe that CraftUI distinguishes itself from many other multi touch technologies in a way that it is a much more practical solution for many applications.
