**bimlights2** is the continuation of [bimlights](/projects/bimlights)

Instead of the full tram network, this one only shows a smaller area around the center of Linz.
In contrast to its predecessor I wanted to use the WS2812 on the new one.
Because it's quite tricky to precisely position and solder SMD LEDs I decided to design a PCB to get them assembled.
Some cardboard is used to adjust an even surface and stick a printed map on to.
Packed into a small frame this makes a fancy little gadget, not easily disclosing its internet-conectivity, when turned off.
