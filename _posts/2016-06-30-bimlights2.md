description: "smaller but more advanced version of bimlights"
---

**bimlights2** is the continuation of [bimlights](/projects/bimlights/).
Instead of the full tram network, this one only shows a smaller area around the center of Linz

Because the first version of bimlights got bricked at the Ars Electronica Festival in 2015 I wanted to create a new, but more robust version of it.
During a last-minute hack on the power supply the LEDs and the controller must have caught too much voltage and said good bye.
