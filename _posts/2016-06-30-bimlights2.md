**bimlights2** is the continuation of [bimlights](/projects/bimlights/).
Instead of the full tram network, this one only shows a smaller area around the center of Linz.

Because the first version of bimlights got bricked at the Ars Electronica Festival in 2015 I wanted to create a new, but more robust version of it.
During a last-minute hack on the power supply the LEDs and the controller must have caught too much voltage and said good bye.

I wanted to use the WS2812 on the new one, so I had to design a PCB to get them assembled.
Some cardboard is used to adjust an even surface and stick a printed map on to.

Packed into a small frame this makes a fancy little gadget, not easily disclosing its internet-conectivity, when turned off.
