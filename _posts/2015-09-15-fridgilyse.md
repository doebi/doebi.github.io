Tracking activity of a fridge, by equipping it with a light sensor and putting it on a scale.

## Hardware
We teared down an ordinary home scale and hooked the four load sensors up with an HX711 Amplifier to an ESP8266.
An additional light sensor inside the fridge is used to detect open and closed state.
